<h1 class="title"> My Favorite Foods </h1>

<h4> Despite the fact that his is very uneeded information, frankly I didnt know what else to make a website about so quickly chose a basic idea that I can easily 
elaborate on. Everyone has their own list of favorite foods but I am going to share you mine because you of course are dying to know. My list will consist of 10 different
foods 1 being my most favorite and 10 being the lowest on the list but not my overall least favorite food.</h4>

<h4> In addition to my list I will give explanations regarding each food describing what it is (what its made of), how often do I eat it, and why its my favorite. 
Lets begin! </h4>
